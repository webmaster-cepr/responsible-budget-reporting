ChangeLog

  From version 1.0 to 1.1:
  
    * Regular expression to remove commas added to budget_amount.value (line 68 of budget_calc_functions.js) since some users were adding commas despite the dropdown menu breaking the numbers into thousands, million, etc...
    * A calculate button was added to the html since some users were not clicking on the equal button to calculate the total.
